# Newton-Cotes methods

Newton-Cotes methods approximate the integral of a function by summing a weighted
combination of the function evaluated at equally-spaced points and nodes. If the
endpoints of the interval of integration are excluded from the sum, the method
is called an open Newton-Cotes method and if the endpoints are included the
method is called a closed Newton-Cotes method.
